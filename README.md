# Attention-based Temporal Gated Recurrent Unit (Att-TGRU)

We developed the Attention-based Temporal Gated Recurrent Unit (Att-TGRU), a novel deep learning framework designed for the efficient and accurate prediction of nonlinear dynamic responses in engineering systems. The proposed framework synergistically integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a self-attention mechanism to decipher complex temporal dependencies. By incorporating residual connections, the model enhances training stability and improves feature extraction capabilities.

This architecture enables the simultaneous capture of both short-term and long-term dependencies in time-series data, surpassing conventional models in resolving challenges related to multiscale spatiotemporal interactions. The performance of Att-TGRU has been validated through both numerical simulations—including thermally induced vibrations, which highlight its high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in noisy environments. Overall, the Att-TGRU framework provides a high-precision computational tool with significant potential for the dynamic reliability assessment of complex mechanical systems.
